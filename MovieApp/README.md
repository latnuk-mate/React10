# Project Anatomy
Movizilla, a movie finder application where you can fild a vast library of movies with specific categories,
The app show you the latest, upcoming and trending movies by fetching real time movie data.


# Project Integration
In this Project, I have used TMDB api, which is very rich for getting real time authentic movie related information. This rich api can satisfy user's need for movies like what's coming on or what's going on.

# API structure...

    This api gives us the latest popular movies.

    This endpoint gives us the trending shows or movies.
