## React Journey Part-1
## This is a small ToDo application I made with React.

## Why am I writing this ReadMe?
To pen down all my learning experiences throughout the Journey.

## I used CDNs instead of any react-build-tools
Now, I chose CDNs for my first project, because to learn things by setting up from the scratch instead of any preConfigured projects by using a build-tool. It helped me to learn the ground level things like, how React actually works, setting the html file for React, and also like configuring babel script & rendering jsx.

## Thing I learnt

while making the Project, I planned to implement some features just to make it more functional. I learned about React Hooks, Implemented React useState and useEffect. React' State is awesome feature, it helps us to access any default value previously set or may be modify it later.In this app, I used State to change the input value and also created Taks-cards to display all TODOs.

React' side Effects are also awesome, I used UseEffect to save the data to the database, when it is created.
side Effect also takes dependencies to update the DOM, When the dependency is changes. Here, I used my Card a dependency, when it update DOM and render content with applied changes.
